# rrobayna's dotfiles

This dotfiles repo contains:

- a collection of dotfiles (vim, bash, tmux...)
- shell scripts
- Brewfiles (install OS X libs and command-line tools)
- Caskfiles (install OS X apps using brew)
- an OS X configuration script
- assorted extras

The bootstrap.sh script is intended to simplify installation and backup actions
for dotfiles and shell scripts.

*Warning: Using the bootstrap.sh script to install dotfiles will overwrite existing dotfiles and shell scripts. Proceed with caution! If you want to retain any of your personal dotfiles and scripts, you might want to perform a backup before installing.*

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrobayna/dotfiles.git
```



### Install dotfiles, scripts and vim plugins

```bash
cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh install
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use
this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository,
or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Rafael Robayna"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="rrobayna@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

### Installing Homebrew and the Brewfile

To install homebrew if it's not already installed and all the packages listed
in the main Brewfile run:

```bash
./bootstrap brew
```

or

```bash
brew bundle osx/Brewfile
```

### Installing OS X Applications using the Homebrew Cask bundler

To install all the OS X desktop apps listed in the Caskfile and link them to your
Applications directory:

```bash
brew bundle osx/Caskfile
```

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./osx/defaults.osx
```

## Backup

### Using bootstrap.sh

To backup changes to you dotfiles and shell script:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh backup
```

This will only backup the files currently included in the projects home/ directory.
To add new dotfiles and scripts, just copy the file into the appropriate
directory. If you want to add a new script or dotfile, copy it over to the repo's home or bin directory and it will be included in any future backups.
