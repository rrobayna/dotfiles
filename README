Bootstrapped configuration files for Linux and OS X:

## Installation

Clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in ~/Projects/dotfiles, with ~/dotfiles as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

git clone https://github.com/rrobayna/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh

Just clone it into your home folder and run install.sh

## Sources
The configs were taking from various sources including:
